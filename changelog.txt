TODO

Secondshapes reportedly work, test this (should look for a code basis for units not secondshaping into themselves via disassembly)

v1.0.6 - 02/11/22

Defaults to generating only 98 blesses, in accordance with blessmodder v1.0.2 and the unterminated table problems.

v1.0.5 - 20/06/22

Capped elegist's value at 2 to prevent it from becoming incarnate (thanks Andy for pointing this one out)
Disabled extra arm bless due to glitchiness with shrouds (thanks kurtcop for this one)
Fixed vine ogre temple train so it doesn't make tigers (thanks Imperator for finding that)
Nerfed reduce unrest down to a bit under half what it was
Increased resist power again somewhat, but it's still below vanilla
Increased cost of damage reversal somewhat (14 -> 16)
Attempted to reduce the number of high level effects generated, but due to the small effect pool this won't always happen
Disabled various aura effects because they only work on commanders when added via bless
Penetration bonus is no longer stackable
Increased the base cost of strength by 1 (now X2 for 1 point, increasing returns with scaling)
Added percentage more likely to cause afflictions
Added nonstackable X1 resist options that give 2 in the resistance type related to the path

v1.0.4 - 28/04/22

Fixed a very stupid mistake in the previous version that broke everything

v1.0.3 - 28/04/22

Removed various buff effects that don't actually work. Some of these even showed up on the UI but didn't actually do anything...

v1.0.2 - 24/04/22

Damage Reversal given Astral crosspath, path level 14 from 10 (this will now be split into 8+8 S/B or something around here)

v1.0.1 - 19/04/22

Automatically created the /output folder. Thanks to Imperator for picking up on what my sleepy brain forgot

v1.0.0 - 19/04/22

Initial upload
